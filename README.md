# File Encryption/Decryption Program

## Description
This program allows you to encrypt or decrypt the contents of a text file using a simple encryption algorithm. It prompts the user to choose between encryption or decryption and input the file name or path. It then processes the file accordingly and saves the result to a new file.

## Skills
- File handling
- String manipulation
- Basic input/output operations

## How to Use
1. **Input**: Run the program and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt a file.
2. **File Selection**: Enter the file name or path of the file you want to process.
3. **Output**: The program will generate a new file with the encrypted or decrypted contents based on your selection.

## Example
Suppose you have a file named `input.txt` with the following content:

### Encryption:
- Input: `input.txt`
- Output: `encrypted_output.txt`
- Encrypted Content: `Jgnnq, uijt jt b uftu gjmf gps fodszqjoh.`

### Decryption:
- Input: `encrypted_output.txt`
- Output: `decrypted_output.txt`
- Decrypted Content: `Hello, this is a test file for encryption.`

## Steps to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the files.
3. Compile and run the Java program.
